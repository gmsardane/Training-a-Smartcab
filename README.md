# training-a-smartcab

This project uses reinforcement Q-learning to train an agent to drive in a grid-like environment. 
Based on rewards and penalties to simulate correct driving in the real-word. Environment parameters are:

+ Light: {*RED*, *GREEN*}
+ Left : {*Oncoming*, *left*, *right*, *None*}
+ Right : {*Oncoming*, *left*, *right*, *None*}
+ Oncoming : {*Oncoming*, *left*, *right*, *None*}

The Q-learning update rule is discussed [here](http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~mlittman/courses/cps271/lect-16/node16.html).

#Tools:

+ Pygame, random, numpy.


### Note that I had to run simulation in Python3, since this is the simplest I could make Pygame to install!
